Mobile Price Classification
This project is aimed at classifying mobile phones into different price ranges based on their features. The model is trained using a dataset of mobile phone attributes and leverages the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighborsClassifier) algorithm to make predictions.

Project Overview
The project uses two datasets:

train.csv: Contains mobile features and their corresponding price ranges. This dataset is used to train the model.
test.csv: Contains mobile features without the price range label. The model will predict the price range for these entries.
Objective
The goal is to predict the price range of mobile phones (e.g., low, medium, high) based on their features, such as battery power, RAM, internal memory, and more. The KNeighborsClassifier is used for this classification task.

Files
train.csv: The dataset used to train the model. It includes various features of mobile phones along with their price ranges.
test.csv: The dataset used for testing the model. It contains mobile phone features, but no price range is provided.
mobileprice.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading data, preprocessing, training the model, and generating predictions.
out.csv: The output file where the model's predictions for test.csv are saved.
Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Load the train.csv and test.csv files.
Handle missing values and perform necessary data preprocessing.
Separate features and labels from train.csv for model training.
Model Training:

The KNeighborsClassifier algorithm is used as the machine learning model.
Hyperparameters like the number of neighbors (k) can be fine-tuned to achieve the best accuracy.
Prediction:

The model is trained using train.csv data.
Once trained, it predicts the price range for the entries in test.csv.
The predictions are saved to out.csv.
Evaluation:

If the true labels for the test set are available, the model performance can be evaluated (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).
